            <h2>Asteroid 2024 MK</h2>
            <p>Asteroid 2024 MK is a near-Earth object approximately 150 meters in diameter, discovered on June 16, 2024, by the ATLAS survey in South Africa. It belongs to the Apollo group of asteroids, which have orbits that cross Earth's path. On June 29, 2024, 2024 MK made a close approach to Earth, passing at a distance of about 295,000 kilometers—approximately 0.77 times the average distance to the Moon. This proximity altered its orbit, shortening its orbital period by about 24 days. Despite its size, the asteroid poses no immediate threat to Earth. Its composition is most similar to an ordinary L-chondrite, and no significant surface changes were detected following the close encounter. The event highlighted the importance of improving our ability to detect and monitor potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, as 2024 MK was discovered only 13 days before its closest approach. The next close approach of 2024 MK is expected in 3037..</p>
