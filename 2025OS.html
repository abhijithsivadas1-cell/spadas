            <h2>Asteroid 2025 OS</h2>
            <p>Asteroid 2025 OS is a near-Earth object that belongs to the Apollo group, a class of asteroids with orbits that cross Earth’s path while spending much of their time outside our planet’s orbit. It is believed to be a stony asteroid, primarily made up of silicate rock and metallic elements such as iron and nickel, which gives it a relatively bright surface compared to darker, carbon-rich types. Its orbit is elliptical and tilted slightly compared to Earth’s orbital plane, allowing it to approach Earth at certain intervals while still traveling far into the outer regions of its path around the Sun. The asteroid is thought to have an irregular, non-spherical shape with surface variations such as craters, ridges, and boulders, formed over billions of years through collisions with smaller space debris. These impacts likely fractured it in the past, leaving behind a rugged structure. Because of its orbit, 2025 OS is carefully monitored as part of planetary defense programs, as asteroids of it Types can sometimes shift trajectories due to gravitational interactions with planets or the Yarkovsky effect (a force caused by uneven heating from the Sun). While current observations suggest it poses no immediate hazard to Earth, its classification as a near-Earth object ensures it remains a subject of continued tracking and study, both for scientific interest and for maintaining awareness of potential future risks..</p>
